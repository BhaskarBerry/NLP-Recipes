## Glossary
### word2vec: 
    > word2vec is the deep learning Google framework to train word embeddings. 
    It will use all the words of the whole corpus and predict the nearby words.
    It will create a vector for all the words present in the corpus in a way so
    that the context is captured. It also outperforms any other methodologies 
    in the space of word similarity and word analogies.
   
    > There are mainly 2 types in word2vec.
        > Skip-Gram
        > Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

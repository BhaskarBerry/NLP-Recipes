## Glossary
### word2vec: 
    > word2vec is the deep learning Google framework to train word embeddings. 
    It will use all the words of the whole corpus and predict the nearby words.
    It will create a vector for all the words present in the corpus in a way so
    that the context is captured. It also outperforms any other methodologies 
    in the space of word similarity and word analogies.
   
    > There are mainly 2 types in word2vec.
        > Skip-Gram
        > Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

# NLP Models
## Follow the below steps to develop the models using the NLP
    > Import the Dataset
    > Cleaning the data set
        - Remove the Numbers from the text 
        - convert all the character to lower case
        - split the words
        - stemming - to remove the alias of the names
        - remove the stop words using corpus
        - Join the split words in to the string
    > Applying the model
